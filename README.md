# Project: Secure Password Generator

## Description
The **Secure Password Generator** is a Python-based tool designed to create strong, random passwords based on user-specified criteria such as length, inclusion of uppercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. It ensures the generated passwords are highly secure and optional functionality allows users to copy passwords directly to their clipboard.
